  </header>
  <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      Around the world, there have been problems regarding waste management and dealing with cleaning waste and garbage.
      There is a huge problem of people all around the world not understanding the purpose of recycling as they would place garbage into recycling and vice versa without realizing the unintended consequences.
      Additionally, the piles of garbage waste are being piled up quicker than ever, causing the lack of space for waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Current solutions deal with providing waste and recycle bins and trying to inform the public through posters arenâ€™t resulting in success.
      Solutions such as 1800Recycling and iRecycle contain information about where to recycle and specifically the items to recycle,
      but they do not give enough information on the current problem and why change needs to occur as soon as possible.
      We aim to gather the necessary data to inform our users on the existing problems of waste management
      and guide them to a better future that can help our generation and many generations to come.
      We found datasets such as the World Management API and the Earth911 API that have relevant data about this topic.
      By gathering information from this API, we would be able to locate the issue and provide solutions to deter waste
      and progress towards a green Earth.

  <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
  <section>
    <p>
      The users of our application will essentially be anyone who is interested in waste management and people who want to create a better world for our future.
      They will be accessing this website to inform themselves on current information to show how we are lacking in this aspect of society
      and different tips on ways we can improve to create a better, eco-friendly future.
      Our application is open to any audience in general though because we want to spread awareness towards waste management.
      Furthermore, will be viewing different interactive tables and graphs that display data of current waste management statistics, which we will grab from
      the <a href="https://api.wm.com">World Management API</a> and the <a href="https://www.programmableweb.com/api/earth911-search-rest-api">Earth911 API</a> and the to deliver this data to our users in an efficient way.
      We would like to show the effects of misplacing garbage and showing how easy it is to correctly dispose of waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our users will be able to interact with our web app in two different forms including a map and graphs.
      The map is interactive with the location input and allows the user to change the location of view.
      The maps will show routes of garbage and recycling and locations to dispose of trash correctly.
      Besides an interactive map, there would be graphs displaying the current damages of misplacing garbage and users would be able to interact by changing the levels of continual garbage misplacement and seeing the future effects of it.
      Vice versa, users can interact with the graph and impose better waste management practices and see their effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this web app will raise awareness towards correct waste management and smartly disposing of trash and waste.
      The current issue is with people not understanding the magnitude of damage that comes with wrongfully disposing of waste.
      This damage causes the companies and our precious Earth.
      This web app hopes to solve this issue by showing people the types of damages that millions of people wrongfully disposing trash can cause.
      This web app hopes to revert the damages by showing people the simplicity and easiness of disposing trash correctly.
