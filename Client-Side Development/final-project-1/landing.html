        <p class="purposeText">Smart Waste Management is here to help educate the citizens of the world on the topic of waste disposal.
          There has been a tremendous issue around the world with people disposing more and more waste. Some of these
          waste are hazardous and most will lead towards landfills pilling up and producing more environmental issues.
          Some trash are recylclable but most people tend to misrecycle garbage and lead towards other items being unrecyclable and tremendous environmental damage.
          As a result, we created this webpage in order to reduce wrongful waste disposal.</p>
